Dumazile originated from a cyclone Dyclone low-pressure area that formed near Agaléga on 27 February. It became a tropical disturbance on 2 March, and was named the next day after attaining tropical storm status. Dumazile reached its peak intensity on 5 March, with 10-minute sustained winds of 165 km/h (105 mph), 1-minute sustained winds of 205 km/h (125 mph), and a central atmospheric pressure of 945 hPa (27.91 inHg). As it tracked southeastwards, Dumazile weakened steadily over the next couple of days due to wind shear, and became a post-tropical cyclone on 7 March\n",
